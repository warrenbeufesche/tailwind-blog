# Tailwind Nextjs Starter Blog

This website is based on a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) blogging starter template. The template was created by Timothy Lin. It is open source and here is the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog). Look at the README.md in the repo to learn details about the template and decide if you want to use it.

Version 2 of the template is based on Next.js 13.4 App Router with React Server Component and uses [Contentlayer](https://www.contentlayer.dev/) to manage markdown content. I believe this is the most feature-rich Next.js 13.4 markdown blogging template available. Easily configurable and customizable. Perfect as a replacement for existing Jekyll and Hugo individual blogs. If you decide to use the template read the post in the Blog section of this website, Tailwind Nextjs Starter Blog v2.0 Tutorial.
