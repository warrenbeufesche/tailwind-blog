In August 2023 the Tailwind Nextjs Starter Blog v2.0 open-source template code was released. This template makes an excellent starting point for a devloper's website and blog. It is an excellent way for developers to learn more about Next.js, Tailwind, Contentlayer, Frontmatter, and Vercel deployment. This codebase supports Next.js 13.4 with the App Router and React Server Components. You can download the code from [GitHub](https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog).
